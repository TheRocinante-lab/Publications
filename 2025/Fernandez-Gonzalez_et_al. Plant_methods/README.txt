Vignette0: Example of the different kinds of two stage models that can be fit to multi-environment trials with open-source software. 
Here, we showcase and compare the single stage model, an unweighted two-stage model and four different types of weighted two-stage models.

Vignette1: Replication of the Vignette1 from StageWise R package using open-source software. Single trait models without genotype by environment interactions.

Vignette2: Replication of the Vignette2 from StageWise R package using open-source software. Single trait models with genotype by environment interactions.

Vignette3: Replication of the Vignette3 from StageWise R package using open-source software. Multi-trait models.
